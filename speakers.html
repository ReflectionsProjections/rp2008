    <div class="talktitle">They make computers out of software, now</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      <p>Systems problems are traditionally solved in either hardware or the
      operating system. Hardware is too expensive to experiment with, while
      OS-based solutions suffer from the chicken-and-egg problem of moving the
      world to your improved OS. The virtual machine monitor (VMM) presents a
      sweet spot between these two extremes. VMM-based solutions can solve a
      problem in software, once, and yet solve it for all popular operating
      systems and applications.</p>
      
      <p>
      I'll be using a new, VMM-based tool called VProbes both to demonstrate the
      scope of what the VMM can intercept, and and as an example of a feature
      that would be difficult to implement in other layers. VProbes provides a
      globally coherent, safe, programmable, interactive window into a running
      machine, from its CPUs to memory to peripherals. </p>

    <div class="aboutspeaker">About Keith Adams</div>
    <div class="bio">
    <p>Keith Adams has worked on VMware's virtual machine monitor  (VMM) since
    graduating from Brown University in 2000. At VMware, he's helped to bring
    support for virtual multiprocessors, hardware CPU and MMU virtualization,
    and dynamic instrumentation to the VMM. Keith has a blog, and likes road
    cycling and playing guitar. He is NOT an official spokesperson for VMware,
    or the Los Gatos Bicycle Racing Club.</p>

    <div class="abstract">
      <p>The modern web browser has evolved from a relatively simple client
      application designed to display static data into a complex networked
      operating system tasked with managing many facets of online experience.
      Support for dynamic content, multimedia data, and third-party plug-ins
      greatly enriches the browsing experience at the cost of increased
      complexity of the browser itself, resulting in a plague of security
      vulnerabilities that provide hackers with easy access to systems. To
      address the root of this problem, we designed and implemented the OP web
      browser. We have partitioned the browser into smaller subsystems, isolated
      each subsystem, and made all communication between subsystems simple and
      explicit. Finally, we have used formal methods to prove the correctness of
      the communications between subsystems and the ability to limit the effects
      of compromised subsystems. </p>

    <div class="abstract">
    <p>Sprinkled amongst both Generation X and Generation Y is a curious, new
    population. The Nerd. The Geek. A group which has spent the last two decades
    moving from the dark technological fringe to a mainstream demographic.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, Rands will first explore the traits of the nerd. How
    is it that we're able to rampantly consume information? How many people do
    we really know? Why is it that we must solve puzzles? How is it that we're
    so good at context switching and so bad at relating to people? And is all
    this nerdery going to help or hinder my career? It's going to help.</p>

    <p>In the second part of this presentation, Rands will explain the role of the
    nerd in high tech and discuss entry strategies into your favorite company.
    We're going to talk about simple ways to leverage your nerd tendencies to
    get you in the right door talking to the right people. </p>

    Borland International, and a start-up that blew through a pile of cash
    before it faded into nothingness.</p>

    <p>Late at night, Rands is the author of the technology, management, and nerd
    weblog where he wonders why managers are so bad at the one thing they should
    do well, whether nerd traits are a hindrance to a healthy career, and
    wonders about the best damned gel pen on the Planet Earth. Rands wrote
    and published a book called "Managing Humans". He's been spotted at
    various conferences around the world, but mostly he'd like to be holed up
    in his Cave with an occasional early morning escape to the sweet, sweet

      <div class="talktitle">A language for the social web: why and how Facebook
      developed the Facebook Markup Language (FBML)</div>
      <div class="abstract">
      <p>
      The Facebook development Platform launched its first API over two
      years ago, in August 2006. Since its launch it has grown to support
      over 400,000 external developers developing thousands of social
      applications and has become the most popular social platform on the
      web.</p>
      
      <p>This is the story of the technical evolution of Platform, from data
      assessors to a simple REST API to the full-fledged development
      platform that it is today. We will discuss the interesting challenges
      we faced in regards to user privacy, the development of the Facebook
      Mark-up Language (FBML) as well as the inherent performance issues
      involved in safeguarding the privacy of over +100 million users and
      how developers can assist us solving them. We'll also talk about the
      future of Platform and FBML with Facebook Connect and the rest of the
      open web.</p>

      <div class="talktitle">Computational Linguistics: What is it and what (if
      any) are its unifying themes?</div>
      <div class="abstract">
      <p>In a well-known cartoon, Randall Munroe characterizes computational
      linguistics as a field "so ill-defined that" practitioners "can subscribe
      to any of dozens of contradictory models and still be taken seriously." As
      with any humor, there is a serious point here. Indeed, it is often quite
      hard to see what the substantive claims of computational linguistics are,
      and how one's model could be falsified (other than by presenting another
      model that has a lower error rate).</p>

      <p>Part of the problem is that a large amount of what counts as computational
      linguistics is essentially natural language engineering, where the point
      is simply to find something that works. And part of the problem is a
      widespread view that has computational linguistics as little more than
      applied machine learning. Nonetheless, there are models and problems that
      serve as unifying themes in the field. Among these are the widespread use
      of finite-state methods, recent work on grammar induction and the growing
      field of computational modeling of evolutionary language change. Each of
      these is interesting not only as a computational problem, but also because
      of the light it may shed on human language.</p>

    <div class="talktitle">Latest Developments in Robotic Hardware</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>Robots have been around for about half a century. Until about a decade
    ago, robotic arms were strictly confined to caged robotic work cells to
    protect the safety of people who might otherwise be harmed by high robotic
    joint torques/forces. The past decade has seen a couple of trends where a
    cage for safety is no longer practical. The first trend is robotic mobility.
    It's not practical to build a fixed cage around a mobile robot, considering,
    for example, Vecna's BEAR robot, designed to rescue wounded soldiers from an
    active battlefield, or the iRobot Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner.</p>

    <p>The second trend is a growing reliance on robots that are necessarily in
    direct contact with people, such as medical patients during
    robotically-assisted surgery or rehabilitation. For example, Barrett's
    robotic WAM arm reduces the invasiveness of knee-implant surgery to
    improve outcome and shorten hospital recovery time. But robot surgery
    requires direct physical contact between robot and patient, again
    challenging the role of a cage. The talk will cover these examples and
    others that show the recent trends away from traditional fixed robotic
    work cells in cages. It will also show innovative ways to improve safety
    as these trends continue. </p>

    <p>Bill Townsend founded Barrett Technology in 1988, credited as maker of
    the world's &quot;most advanced robotic arm&quot; in the special Millennium Edition of
    the Guinness Book of World Records. Barrett's WAM arm and BarrettHand
    products operate in 15 countries around the globe today; and the WAM is the
    only arm approved by the FDA for force-controlled (haptic) surgery, having
    performed 100s of successful knee-implant surgeries across the US.</p>

    <p>Bill holds engineering PhD and MS degrees from MIT and a BS from
    Northeastern. He has been awarded 8 US patents and won several professional
    awards including The Robotic Industries Association's Joseph Engelberger
    Award in 2003 for pioneering the first haptic robot in the 1980s and
    best-paper-of-the-year award from UK-journal, Industrial Robot, in 2005.
